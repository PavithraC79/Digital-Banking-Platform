# 🏦 Digital Banking Platform Simulation – Business Analyst Project

This repository contains a comprehensive simulation of a **Digital Banking Platform** project designed from a **Business Analyst's perspective**. 
The project demonstrates the end-to-end lifecycle of core banking modules — 
including user onboarding, loan application, transaction management, and account operations — documented through BRDs, functional specifications, user stories, test cases, and flow diagrams.

## 🚀 Project Purpose

To simulate the practical responsibilities of a Business Analyst using agile practices and tools like **JIRA**, **Confluence**, and **Draw.io**, 
and to document the digital transformation of traditional banking workflows.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

- **JIRA** – User story mapping, epic planning, and sprint breakdown  
- **Confluence** – Requirement documentation, BRDs, FSDs, and test case management  
- **Draw.io** – Visual flow diagrams for functional clarity  
- **Power BI** – Simulated dashboards for performance insights  
- **Agile Methodology** – Simulated sprint planning, backlog grooming, and UAT tracking

## 🧩 Flow Diagrams (Draw.io Visuals)

This project includes four detailed **process flow diagrams** created using **Draw.io**, visualizing the end-to-end workflows of core digital banking modules.
These diagrams support the BRD, FSD, and UAT documentation by providing clarity to stakeholders, developers, and testers.

### 🔄 General Workflow Structure

Each diagram follows a structured logic:

1. **Start Node** – Triggered user/system action  
2. **Action Steps** – Inputs, data entries, or selections  
3. **Decision Points** – Validations, authentication, eligibility  
4. **Outcomes** – Success messages, rejections, redirects  
5. **End Node** – Complet
